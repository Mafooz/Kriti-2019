This is source code of a Website aimed for students of IIT Guwahati for simplifying the access of required study material in thier day to day life.

Following are the main highlights of the website:

1. Courses on this site can be accessed by anyone without any need of logging in.
2. Students can upload study material which will get approved by admin and then will be added to the website. For that, the user must verify that he/she is the student of IIT Guwahati by entering his/her login creditials...
3. There might be a case that a student is looking for a particular course which is unavailable on the website. In that case, he/she can fill a form which with required details and that will be sent to the admin.
4. Admin can add videos as well as courses. Idea is to make the club secretaries as admin of this website so that they can have the freedom of adding different courses and videos.
